This driver allows the host to communicate with H\+I\+D-\/compliant Auxiliary Display based on Arduino.\+The main idea of this library is to provide a simple unified communication with the small L\+CD displays supported by Arduino. Such displays can be used for showing system information such as hardware temperature, fan speed, percentage of memory available etc., and used by host applications as necessary. H\+I\+D\+L\+CD is build on top of the H\+I\+D\+A\+PI library and provides the next level of abstraction specific to the H\+I\+D-\/compliant auxiliary L\+CD displays.
